# Overview #
This project leverages Google Generative AI (Gemini API) and Flask to create a session-based chatbot designed specifically for generating recommendations in multiple domains. The chatbot is fine-tuned to provide suggestions for movies, TV series, restaurants, books, and online courses, while intentionally avoiding responses unrelated to these areas.
## Features ##

**Domain-Specific Recommendations**: The chatbot is specialized in offering personalized recommendations across the following domains:

- Movies
- TV Series
- Restaurants
- Books
- Online Courses


**Session-Based Interaction**: The Flask-based backend manages user sessions, allowing for continuous and contextual conversations without losing track of prior interactions.

**Strict Domain Adherence**: The chatbot is explicitly designed to avoid providing responses outside the specified recommendation domains, ensuring a focused and relevant user experience.
